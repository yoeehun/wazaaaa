                        <strong>Dear Lyean Jediah,</strong>
                        <p>Hi!! uhm... I'm super thankful for you for being there for me when I was vulnerable, kahit naman siguro normal days ko. I'm very grateful to have known you. You're a great person that's why I can't help myself from falling for you even more. Your beautiful both outside and inside. I was actually supposed to say this yesterday pero you know naman na what happened. You've mentioned na you don't want situationships and I do agree with you kasi ako rin naman. I know I'm not in my best right now kasi I'm still studying and can't give you anything pa, but I will do my absolute best to make you happy. I know it's a bit early for me to ask you this or not? JAHAHAH pero I don't wanna let this chance go away now that it's in front of me. So with that!!
                            <strong> MAY I COURT YOU, MISS LYEAN JEDIAH?</strong> <br> <br>No need to rush in answering HAHAHHA take all the time you want. I can wait.                                          <br> 
                            <p>
